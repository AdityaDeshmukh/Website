== A deviation bound in multi-armed bandits
For this conjecture, I refer the reader to this [https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume22/18-798/18-798.pdf paper]. The conjecture is that the bound provided in the paper also holds (perhaps with slight modifications) for multi-parameter exponential families. I believe the current analysis is not sufficient for the extension and other tools need to be developed.

== Efficient and optimal algorithm for robust mean estimation
For this conjecture, I refer the reader to the table in [/publications.html \[\/publications.html\]]
